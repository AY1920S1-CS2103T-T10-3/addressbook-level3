== Introduction

image::ug_introduction.png[]

Hello, I am an Extremely Loud and Intelligent Student Assistant (ELISA)!

I am here to be *your intelligent companion that keeps track of your tasks and remind you to take breaks*.

Although I am *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI), I also have a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, I can get your tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Enjoy!

== Quick Start

== Features
Now we'll be presenting what you've been waiting for... our features! +
But hold on, to fully appreciate our features, you might want to go through some of the command guidelines first. +
These are some mistakes that our users(and even us) would make initially, and they can be really unpleasant, so we hope that you won't have to go though them.
For your viewing pleasure, we've collated it nicely into a quick starter pack below, let's start!

image::ug_features.png[]

This table shows the basic rules for the formatting the input:

.Command Guidelines
|===
|Guidelines: |Description: |Correct usage:
|Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user | If given `task DESCRIPTION` description is to be provided. |`task shower`
|All flags *MUST* have a _space_ after them | `task shower -d10.min.later` is *incorrect*. It should be `task shower -d 10.min.later` | `task shower -d 10.min.later`
|Flags in square brackets are optional | If given `task DESCRIPTION [-t TAG]` tag is optional a| `task shower` +
 `task shower -t clean`

|Flags can be in any order, given that they are accepted by the command | If given `task DESCRIPTION [-d DATETIME] [-r REMINDER]` -r can come before -d a| `task shower -d 1.hour.later -r 30.min.later` +
 `task shower -r 30.min.later -d 1.hour.later`
|Flags must not be repeated in the same input, unless it is a tag flag | `task shower -p high -p low` is *incorrect* as -p appears twice. However, `task bathe -t fresh -t hygiene` is accepted| `task shower -p high`
|For the parser of mm.min.later, hh.hour.later, dd.day.later, the maximum allowed is 100 | `101.min.later` is not accepted, however `100.min.later` or `99.day.later` are both accepted. | `task study -d 99.day.later`
|===


This is a quick summary of all our flags. +

For *first time* users: +

* You can choose to skip through this first as it may seem overwhelming now.
* But as you go along the different sections and see new flags, it might be useful to refer to this as it can help you understand it's accepted parameters.

For *more experienced* users: +

* This can be your best buddy! We understand that sometimes it can be troublesome to look through the entire guide just to find the flag you want.

image:Uncompleted.PNG[Not done, title="Not done"] shows that you have yet to complete this task. +
image:EventIcon.PNG[Event, title="Event"] shows that this is an Event with the date shown in its eyes. +

[WARNING]
All time dependent elements such as deadline, reminder and calendar time are dependent on the *system time*

If you face any issues, please check the <<Additional Notes>>. If it is not mentioned there, then feel free to bring it up to us!


Now we are ready to jump into the features itself!

=== CLI Features

==== Adding a task: `task`

Adds a task to the task list +

It is not possible to set a reminder in the past.

==== Editing an item : `edit`

This command is used to edit any of the items that you might have. +

===== *Limitations* +

* You are only able to edit the item currently shown in your view. For example, when you're on the task list, you can only edit the tasks shown. You will not be able to edit events or reminders.
* The new item with the edited fields must not already exist. Don't worry if you can't remember that, ELISA will remind you!

Format: `edit INDEX [-desc DESCRIPTION] [-d DATETIME] [-r REMINDER] [-p PRIORITY] [-t TAG]...`

****
* Edits the task at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in currently viewed list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 -desc read books -d 3.day.later -p low` +

=== Reminder Feature

So focused on your work that you forget the other tasks in your life?
Don't worry! You can ask ELISA to remind you to do what you need to do, when you need to do it!

Simply add a reminder

[[snooze]]
==== Snoozing a reminder: `snooze`

Snoozes a reminder that occurred since the application was open. +
If an index is not provided, the most recently occurred reminder will be snoozed. +
If a snooze duration is not specified, the reminder will be snoozed at the default duration of 5 min. +
Format: 'snooze [INDEX] [-s SNOOZE_DURATION]' +

Examples:
* `snooze 1`
* `snooze 3 -s 10.min.later`
* `snooze -s 10/10/2020 1400`

[NOTE]
1. It is possible to snooze the same reminder multiple times if you wish. +
2. It is not possible to snooze if no reminder has occurred yet. +
However, if you use the snooze command incorrectly, ELISA will first attempt to correct your usage of the snooze command.

=== Navigation Features

==== Show the specified category : `show`

Shows the specified category by switching the view to the given list. +
Format: `show [t] [e] [c] [r] (Exactly *one* flag must be used with this command)''

[NOTE]
The flag can be in either lowercase or uppercase. Eg. `show E`.

==== Scrolling the list : `up` / `down`

Scrolls the list up/down

=== Visual Features

==== Expanding an item in the view: `open` & `close`
Want to see all the details of an item at one glance? Lazy to go to event list or reminder list to find them? We got you!

You can now open up an item to see all its details, regardless of what list you are on.
But remember to close it before opening another item!

Open format: `open INDEX` +
Close format: `close`

Example sequence:

* `show T` - to switch to the task view
* `open 2` - opens the second item on the list
* `close` - closes the item
* `open 3` - opens the third item on the list (Note: If you forgot to close previously, no worries as ELISA will prompt you to!)
* `close` - closes the item

[WARNING]
Although, the ESC key can close too, we do not advise doing so as ELISA may be confused later on :(


==== Changing the theme : `theme`

Screen is too dark? Switch up the theme by typing `theme white`!

.White theme of ELISA

Too stressed from all the work? Check out these features to take a short break so that you can go further!

==== Play a game: `game`

`game` switches your list of tasks into a game of Snakes!

There are 2 modes to the game: `easy` and `hard`. Type `game hard` to enter the hard mode of the game!

Controls: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`

.Snake game `EASY` +
image::SnakeGame.PNG[Snake, 600, 600]


`EASY`

New to the game? Try out the `easy` mode, where all you have to do is collect the food, which is indicated by the pink box. Biting your own tail will result in GAME OVER! Be careful!

.Snake game `HARD` +
image::snakegamehard.PNG[SnakeHard, 600, 600]


`HARD`

Find the game too easy? Enter the `hard` mode and there will be 20 random walls (indicated by blue box) placed all around the game. Colliding with any of these walls will result in a GAME OVER! You will need to navigate through these walls to collect your food!


`EXIT`

Realised that you have played for too long and want to get back to work? Hitting the `ESC` key will exit the game and return you to your list of tasks!

// tag::joke[]
=== Asking ELISA for a joke : `joke`
Need to amuse yourself for a bit? Simply use the `joke` command and ELISA will select a joke from her database for you to enjoy!

****
* Note that each joke is randomly selected from the database and may repeat.
****

Example:

* `joke` +

// end::joke[]

=== Undo/Redo Feature

// tag::undo[]
==== Undoing the latest modification(s) : `undo`

Reverts the latest commands given on the ELISA. +
Format: `undo`

****
* `undo` can only be done if commands have been executed
****

Examples:

* `undo` +
Undoes the last command

// end::undo[]

// tag::redo[]
==== Redoing the latest undone command(s) : `redo`

Re-executes the latest undone commands given on the ELISA. +
Format: `redo`

****
* `redo` can only be done if undo has already been executed
* After `undo`, if a new command is executed then `redo` cannot be executed
****

Examples:

* `redo` +

//end::redo[]

=== Sort/Find/Priority Feature

//tag::sort[]
==== Sorting ELISA out: `sort`

Is ELISA getting too cluttered and disorganized? Do you want to sort your task by their priority? Or the events by their start date?

ELISA comes in-built with a sort feature that allows you to sort your items within the different panel. And the best part of it? YOU can decide how you want to sort it.

The simple sort command on the different panel sorts the list differently (just another sign of how smart ELISA is) and they are as follows:

* task panel - tasks are sorted from those that are incomplete to those that are completed. Within the two groups, they are sorted based on their priority, from high to medium and to low.

* event panel - events are sorted based on their start date and time.

* reminder - reminders are sorted based on their firing off date and time.

But why stop there? You are also able to sort by priority and description within all the panels and even combine different sorting together! You are only limited by your imagination (and the items within your lists).

Format: `sort` or `sort <criteria>`

Examples:

* `sort` - a simple sort that follows the criteria mentioned above for the different panel.
* `sort pri` - sorts the item within the panel by their priority (from high to low).
* `sort desc` - sorts the item within the panel by their description (lexicographic order)
//end::sort[]

//tag::find[]
==== Finding a task: `find`

Is your task list getting too long and you are not able to find what you are looking for? Introducing the `find` function which will allow you to find what you want within the specific panel. Just type `find` and the keywords that you want to search for within the command box and ELISA will find the relevant items for you.

.ELISA before find command
image::BeforeFind.PNG[]

.ELISA after find command
image::AfterFind.PNG[]


Format: `find <keyword>`

Examples:

* `find CS2101` - find all items that have CS2101 in their description within that panel

* `find CS2101 CS2103` - find items that contains either CS2101 or CS2103 within their description.
//end::find[]

//tag::priority[]
==== Entering priority mode: `priority`
Feeling overwhelmed by the sheer amount of tasks to do? Enter priority mode, a mode which will help you narrow down the most pressing task to be done.

.ELISA before priority mode with a long list of tasks
image::BeforePriority.PNG[500,500]


By simply typing `priority` into the command box, you will be given one single task of the highest priority among your task list. This task is chosen by ELISA base on priority and the order in which the task was added to the list.


.ELISA in priority mode
image::AfterPriority.PNG[500,500]

Notice that the ELISA icon turns red to signify that you are in priority mode and your task list has shrunk from 5 tasks down to the 1 most important task.

When you are done with your current task, just tell ELISA you are done by simply typing `done 1` and ELISA will generate the next task for you.

.ELISA after completing the first task
image::AfterDone.PNG[500,500]

Feeling less stressed? You can type `priority` again to bring you out of the priority mode and back into the normal task view. Or even better, finish all your undone tasks and you will be automatically brought out of priority mode.


.ELISA after all tasks are completed
image::AllDone.PNG[500,500]

Feeling lazy? You can also opt to turn off priority mode at a specific time by typing `priority dd/mm/yyyy hhmm` and ELISA will turn it off at that specific time for you.

There is also an extreme focus mode for the easily distracted. Simply tell ELISA that you want to enter the extreme focus mode by attaching a `-f` flag to the back of the command. In the extreme focus mode, commands such as `show`, `sort`, `find`, `game`, `event` and `reminder` are banned.

Format: `priority [DATETIME] [-f]`

Examples:

* `priority` - activates or deactivates the priority mode
* `priority 30/10/2019 1200` - activates the priority mode and ask ELISA to turn it off on 30/10/2019 at noon
* `priority 2.hour.later -f` - activates the focus mode and ask ELISA to turn it off 2 hours later

****
* Note that this command can only be called in the task panel and when you have incomplete tasks to be completed.
* Note that if priority mode is currently on, any variation of `priority` will turn it off.
* Note that all command such as `edit`, `undo` and `redo` still works in priority mode. However, if a `done` or `delete` command takes you out of priority mode and then you `undo` it, it will only `undo` the command but will not take you back into priority mode.
****
//end::priority[]

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

=== Saving the data
ELISA saves the data in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.
There is no need to save manually.

== Additional Notes
=== Input
* Currently, an empty input can be entered, but ELISA will show an invalid command.

=== Calendar

* Currently, it only shows *1 event* on each date due to limited space on the calendar. If there are more events on that date, to find them all, you can go to the event list and sort through it.
* Currently, it only shows the *current* month. We are still working to bring the next month to you.
* Please keep a full screen. If you resize, we are unable to guarantee the view of the calendar.
