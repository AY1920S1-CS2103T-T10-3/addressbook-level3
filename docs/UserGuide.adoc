== Introduction

Extremely Loud and Intelligent Student Assistant (ELISA) is for students who *wants to have an intelligent companion that keeps track of tasks and give friendly reminders on when to take breaks*. More importantly, ELISA is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ELISA can get your tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `elisa.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for ELISA.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all tasks
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd item shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

.Command Guidelines
|===
|Guidelines: |Description: |Correct usage:
|Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user | If given `task DESCRIPTION` description is to be provided. |`task shower`
|All flags *MUST* have a _space_ after them | `task shower -d10.min.later` is *incorrect*. It should be `task shower -d 10.min.later` | `task shower -d 10.min.later`
|Flags in square brackets are optional | If given `task DESCRIPTION [-t TAG]` tag is optional | `task shower` `task shower -t clean`
|Flags can be in any order, given that they are accepted by the command | If given `task DESCRIPTION [-d DATETIME] [-r REMINDER]` -r can come before -d | `task shower -d 1.hour.later -r 30.min.later` `task shower -r 30.min.later -d 1.hour.later`
|Flags must not be repeated in the same input | `task shower -p high -p low` is *incorrect* as -p appears twice | `task shower -p high`

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding a task: `task`

Adds a task to the task list +

To create a task quickly, just include the description as Task can have no flags (ie `task shower`).

* `task eat my vitamins -d 10.hour.later -p low -t healthy`

=== Adding an event: `event`

Adds an event to events list and calendar +
Format: `event DESCRIPTION -d DATETIME [-r REMINDER] [-p PRIORITY] [-t TAG]`

Examples:

* `event John’s Birthday -d 20/09/2019 1800`
* `event John’s Birthday -d 20/09/2019 1800 -r 19/09/2019 1800`

Format: `reminder DESCRIPTION -r REMINDER [-t TAG]`

Examples:

* `reminder John’s Birthday -r 19/09/2019 14:00`

* `reminder John's Birthday -r 3.day.later`

=== Show the specified category : `show`

Shows the specified category by switching the view to the given list. +
Format: `show [t] [e] [c] [r] (Exactly one flag must be used with this command)''

Examples:

* `show t`
* `show e`
* `show r`
* `show c`

=== Editing an item : `edit`

This command is used to edit any of the items that you might have. +

====== *Limitations* +

* You are only able to edit the item currently shown in your view. For example, when you're on the task list, you can only edit the tasks shown. You will not be able to edit events or reminders.
* The new item with the edited fields must not already exist.

Format: `edit INDEX [-desc DESCRIPTION] [-d DATETIME] [-r REMINDER] [-p PRIORITY] [-t TAG]...`

****
* Edits the task at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in currently viewed list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 -desc read books -d 3.day.later -p low` +
Edits item 1 of the current list. Changes the description to `read books`, deadline to `3.day.later` and priority to `low`.
* `edit 3 -desc CS2103 team meeting -r 3.hour.later -p high` +
Edits item 2 of the current list. Changes the description to `CS2103 team meeting`, reminder to `3.hour.later` and priority to `high`.

// tag::delete[]
=== Deleting a reminder/task/event : `delete`

Deletes the reminder/task/event from ELISA. +
Format: `delete INDEX`

****
* Deletes the item at the specified `INDEX` of the current list shown.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* No flags should be given with this command.
****

Examples:

* `show r` +
`delete 2` +
Deletes the 2nd reminder in the shown reminder list.


// tag::undo[]
=== Undoing the latest modification(s) : `undo`

Reverts the latest commands given on the ELISA. +
Format: `undo [number of commands]`

****
* Omitting the number reverts the last one command
* The number of commands must be *at most 20*
* The number *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

* `undo` +
Undoes the last command
* `undo 2` +
Undoes the last 2 commands

=== Sorting ELISA out: `sort`
Is ELISA getting too cluttered and disorganized? Do you want to sort your task by their priority? Or the events by their start date?

ELISA comes in-built with a sort feature that allows you to sort your items within the different panel. And the best part of it? YOU can decide how you want to sort it.

The simple sort command on the different panel sorts the list differently (just another sign of how smart ELISA is) and they are as follows:

* task panel - tasks are sorted from those that are incomplete to those that are completed. Within the two groups, they are sorted based on their priority, from high to medium and to low.
* event panel - events are sorted based on their start date and time.
* reminder - reminders are sorted based on their firing off date and time.

But why stop there? You are also able to sort by priority and description within all the panels and even combine different sorting together! You are only limited by your imagination (and the items within your lists).

Format: `sort` or `sort <criteria>`

Examples:

* `sort` - a simple sort that follows the criteria mentioned above for the different panel.
* `sort priority` - sorts the item within the panel by their priority (from high to low).
* `sort desc` - sorts the item within the panel by their description (lexicographic order)

=== Finding a task: `find`
Is your task list getting too long and you are not able to find what you are looking for? Introducing the `find` function which will allow you to find what you want within the specific panel. Just type `find` and the keyword that you want to search for within the command box and ELISA will find the relevant items for you.

Format: `find <keyword>`

Examples:

* `find CS2101` - find all items that have CS2101 in their description within that panel

* `find CS2101 CS2103` - find items that contains either CS2101 or CS2103 within their description.

=== Entering priority mode: `priority`
Feeling stress? Too much task on your task list? Enter priority mode, a mode which will help you narrow down the most pressing task to be done.

By simply typing `priority` into the command box, you will be given one single task of the highest priority among your task list. This task is chosen by ELISA at random.

Feeling less stress? You can type `priority` again to bring you out of the priority mode and back into the normal task view. Or even better, finish all your undone task and you will be automatically brought out of priority mode.

Feeling lazy? You can also opt to turn off priority mode at a specific time by typing `priority dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm` and ELISA will turn it off at that specific time for you.

Format: `priority` or `priority dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm`

Examples:

* `priority` - activates or deactivates the priority mode
* `priority 30/10/2019 1200` - activates the priority mode and ask ELISA to turn it off on 30/10/2019 at noon
* `priority 2.hours.later` - activates the priority mode and ask ELISA to turn it off 2 hours later

****
* Note that this command can only be called in the task panel.
* Note that all command such as `edit`, `undo` and `redo` still works in priority mode. However, if `undo` is called, the viewing list will not revert back to the previous view unless `undo` causes a task of a higher priority than the current one to be undone.
****

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

=== Saving the data
ELISA saves the data in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.
There is no need to save manually.
