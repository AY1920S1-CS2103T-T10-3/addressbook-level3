== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `Item` : Used by classes to represent a task, event, reminder or any combination of the three.
* `Task` : Used by classes to store, access and modify details regarding tasks.
* `Events` : Used by classes to store, access and modify details regarding events.
* `Reminders` : Used by classes to store, access and modify details regarding reminders.
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicComponentUML.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ElisaParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `ItemModel` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.
.  More instructions for the `Ui` can be given through implementing `ScrollCommand`

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Item Storage data
* exposes four observable lists that can be viewed by the Ui and will cause an update in the Ui when it is updated

[NOTE]
The reason for using four observable list as opposed to having one observable list that is filtered every time we update the list is because we believe that this will lead to faster loading time every time we switch view as it is just a change in the Visualization List pointer. This is better than the O(n) method of filtering a single VisualizeList as it will require going through all the items in the list.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Item Storage data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undobyreverse[]
=== [Implemented] Undo Feature
==== Current Implementation Logic

The undo function uses the revert command method without using states and history, unlike the proposed method.
This is because an issue was encountered with referencing lists and firing reminders multiple times when the state history method was used.

In this implementation, the commands that can be undone; that is, all the commands except `UndoCommand`, `ExitCommand`,
`UpCommand` and `DownCommand` now extend from an abstract class `UndoableCommand`, which is a subclass of Command.
Subclasses of `UndoableCommand` must implement a method `reverse(ItemModel model)`, which should do the exact opposite
of the `execute(ItemModel model)` in that Command.

The command execution history is stored in a stack, which is maintained in `ElisaCommandHistory`.

Below is a possible usage scenario and the app behaviour.

Step 1. The user executes `task eat`. A task with description "eat" is added and then the command is pushed into the commands stack.

image::UndoStackStep1.png[]

Step 2. The user realises that adding the task was a mistake, and decides to undo by entering `undo` into ELISA. The `undo` command
will pop the `AddTaskCommand` from the stack and reverse the effects of that command, in this case by deleting the task "eat" from the `TaskList`.

image::UndoStackStep2.png[]

Step 3. After successful execution of the `UndoCommand` a confirmation message is displayed in the chat box.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::priority[]
=== Priority Mode

==== Implementation

The priority mode is used to aid the user in focusing on the most pressing task that they have especially when they have many tasks in their list. As priority mode is only for clearing of tasks, the priority mode can only be activated at the task pane of the application.

The priority mode is mainly controlled in the ```ItemModelManager``` and the following are the methods it implements within the ```ItemModelManager```:

* ```ItemModelManager#togglePriorityMode()``` - Toggle the priority mode depending on whether it is on or off.
* ```ItemModelManager#toggleOnPriorityMode()``` - Helper function to toggle on the priority mode.
* ```ItemModelManager#toggleOffPriorityMode()``` - Helper function to toggle off the priority mode.

There are two variants to the priority mode, a normal priority mode and a focus mode. The focus mode is more restrictive than the normal priority mode. It prevents the user from doing any task that are not relevant to the task list, such as adding a new event or switching the pane. This is currently implemented by having a boolean to check if the application is in focus mode. (Refer to )

There are two way to trigger the priority mode, a normal priority mode that is controlled fully by the user and a scheduled priority mode that is triggered by the user but is scheduled to turn off after a specific amount of time. In addition to using the above three methods, the ```ScheduledPriorityMode``` also uses the following method:

* ```ItemModelManager#startTimer(LocalDateTime)``` - Starts a timer to turn off the priority mode.

==== Example run of code

In the following section, we will be showing a run of the priority mode and a broad overview of the mechanism at each step. In particular, we will be showing how the ```ScheduledPriorityMode``` works as it has a more complicated implementation than the normal ```PriorityMode```.

. The user opens his ELISA software. The first screen that he observes will be the task screen which contains all the task of the user based on the time they were added into the list.

. The user types ```priority 30.min.later``` into the command box of ELISA and hits enter. The incomplete items are added to a ```PriorityQueue<Item>``` where they are ranked by their priority and if they have the same priority, the item that is added to ELISA first will have a higher ranking.

. Once all the items are added into the ```PriorityQueue<Item>```, ELISA will peek the first task from the queue and present it to the user.

. The user can type ```done 1``` when he is done with the current task to retrieve the next task. This will carry on until there is no more undone task left to do in the priority queue. This is shown in the activity diagram below.

.Activity diagram for priority mode
image::PriorityModeActivityDiagram.png[]

[start=5]
. ELISA will automatically disable the priority mode after 30 minutes and show *all* the task that the user have in his task list currently.

==== Internal working of the command
The figure below shows the sequence diagram on what happens from a simple execution of the ```priority 30.min.later``` command. We will be going through step by step the internal mechanism of the execution of the ```ScheduledPriorityCommand```.

.Sequence diagram for priority mode
image::PriorityMode.png[]

Step 1. When the user types in the command, the ```LogicManager``` takes in the command as a string and pass it to the ```AddressBookParser```

Step 2. The ```AddressBookParser``` parses the string and determine whether the command is that of a normal ```PriorityCommand``` or a ```ScheduledPriorityCommand```.

In this case, the command is that of a ```ScheduledPriorityCommand``` and so a new ```ScheduledPriorityCommand``` is created. This ```ScheduledPriorityCommand``` is passed back to the ```LogicManager```.

[NOTE]
The following steps (except those marked with a *) are also applicable to ```PriorityCommand```.

Step 3. Within the ```LogicManager```, the ```ScheduledPriorityCommand#execute()``` method is called and the command is executed.

Step 4*. The ```ScheduledPriorityCommand``` calls the ```ItemModel#scheduleOffPriorityMethod()``` which creates a new ```Timer``` object and a new ```TimerTask``` object. The ```TimerTask``` object will be scheduled to fire off at a specific time, which in this case is 30 minutes later (as defined by the user).

Step 5. The ```SchedulePriorityCommand``` then calls ```ItemModel#togglePriorityMode()``` which calls the private method ```ItemModel#toggleOnPriorityMode()``` (since the current state of the priority mode is false).

Step 6. This creates a new ```TaskList``` which will be the visualization list for the Task Panel throughout the entire priority mode period.

Step 7. A ```CommandResult``` is passed to the ```ScheduledPriorityCommand``` and then back to the ```LogicManager``` to be passed into the ```Ui```, informing the user that the priority mode is activate.

[NOTE]
A normal ```PriorityCommand``` will end at this point and will only be deactivated by the user's input of ```priority``` again.

.Sequence diagram for the scheduled turning off of priority mode
image::PriorityMode2.png[]

Step 8. As the ```Timer``` within the ```ItemModelManager``` is still running on a separate thread, it will trigger the ```TimerTask#run()``` when the user defined time is reached.

Step 9. The ```TimerTask``` will call ```ItemModelManager#toggleOffPriorityMode()``` which will cancel the ```Timer``` and destroy the ```Timer```. This is to ensure that the program can be closed properly.

Step 10. The items are all added back into the ```TaskList``` and the priority mode is considered deactivated.

==== Design Consideration
*Aspect: How to restrict commands for focus mode*

* Alternative 1 (Current implementation): Storing a boolean within the ``ItemModelManager`` to check if the application is in focus mode or normal mode. Commands that are not allowed to be called in focus mode will check against this boolean to determine if the command is allowed.

|===
|Pros |Cons

|This implementation will contain the changes within the class of the ```Command``` itself and will ensure that they do not interfere with each other. This will make it easier to maintain the code.
|This implementation is not scalable as each new ```Command``` that is added will need to be checked to see if they are allowed in focus mode. There is also the additional overhead of checking the state of the ```ItemModelManager``` at every call of ```Command#execute()```.
|===

* Alternative 2: Create a new ```FocusElisaParser``` that extends from the current ```ElisaParser``` but prevent the parsing of commands that are not allowed in focus mode.

|===
|Pros |Cons

|This implementation stops the creation of the ```Command``` at the ```Parser``` level which will reduce the computational cost to the application.
|This implementation requires the manipulation of the ```LogicManager``` to change the parser that is being used which goes against the current implementation of ```Command#execute()```. There might also be more difficulty when maintaining the code as there is a need to maintain the ```Parser#parse()``` method of the two ```Parser```.
|===

Both methods are not scalable in the long run, but at this moment, alternative 1 is favoured as it conforms with the current implementation of the ``Command#execute(ItemModel)`` method which states that the command should only interact with the ``ItemModel`` and not directly with the ``Logic`` itself.

*Aspect: How to turn off the priority mode after a fixed time*

* Alternative 1: Having two different classes for activating the priority mode, a normal ```PriorityCommand``` and a ```ScheduledPriorityCommand``` that extends from the ```PriorityCommand```. The timer will be activated in the ```ScheduledPriorityCommand```.


|===
|Pros |Cons

|Adheres to the SLAP principle with each class having it's own implementation of the ```Command#execute(ItemModel)```. This makes it easier to maintain the code and prevents from overloading the ```ItemModelManager``` by keeping the timer there.
|There is no way to end the schedule priority mode prematurely as the timer is kept within the command and so cannot be referenced after the execution of the command.
|===

* Alternative 2 (Current implementation): Having a timer within the ```ItemModelManager``` and having a specific method within the ```ItemModelManager``` to handle this creation of the timer.

|===
|Pros|Cons

|The timer can be referenced from the ```ItemModelManager``` and so it can be cancelled prematurely if the user chooses to do so.
|This implementation will clutter the ```ItemModelManager``` further and make it harder for maintaining the code.
|===

Alternative 2 was chosen as we believe that the ability to cancel a scheduled priority mode prematurely takes priority over the maintainability of the code and should be used until a better method can be created.

==== Possible extension

At the moment, the user is not able to keep track of the amount of time that he have before the schedule priority mode is over. This could be overcome by including a countdown timer in the Ui when the user toggles on the scheduled priority mode.

// end::priority[]

// tag::dataencryption[]

=== Add Task/Event feature
Task, Events and Reminders are all Items and can be added using the *same* command. Adding of Items is facilitated by ItemModel#add(Item). +

==== Implementation
A Task with a deadline flag `-d` will be considered an Event. A Task with a reminder flag `-r` will be considered a Reminder. +
The following activity diagram shows the how a task can be added, depending on the flags present:

.Activity Diagram of adding a Task
image::AddTaskActivity.png[200, 600]

This shows how we can easily add Task, Event and Reminder with a _single_ command.
However, in this section, we will only show how Task and Event is added. Adding of Reminders is shown in a separate section as it includes other steps.

==== Internal workings of the command
Given below is an example usage scenario of how add behaves at each step: +

Step 1. The user enters the command `"task shower -d 1.hour.later"`. +
Step 2. The LogicManager creates an AddressBookParser to parse the user input. +
Step 3. AddressBookParser creates a AddTaskCommandParser which parses the input and returns an AddCommand. +
Step 4. LogicManager will execute the AddCommand. AddCommand will then invoke `ItemModel#add(Item)`, which adds Task to its TaskList and Event to its EventList. +
Step 5. AddCommand will also trigger a change in view by calling `ItemModel#setVisualList(taskList)`
Step 6. Upon the successful execution of AddCommand, a CommandResult is returned to the LogicManager, which will then be returned to the Ui to render the appropriate view.

The figures below shows the sequence diagram on what happens from a simple execution of `task shower -d 1.min.later` user command: +

.Call execute in LogicManager to create an AddTaskCommand
image::AddCommandPart_1.png[]

This diagram shows how `execute` is carried out in the `Logic` component.
The following diagram shows how the same command is continued onto the `Model` component:

.LogicManager executes the AddTaskCommand and returns CommandResult
image::AddCommandPart_2.png[]

This shows how `execute(model)` affects the `Model` component. It then returns a `CommandResult` r, which is the result of calling LogicManager#execute("task shower -d 1.hour.later").

==== Design considerations
The design considerations for the classes are shown below:
|===
|Alternatives: |Pros: |Cons:
|1. Placing all fields into an Item object and retrieving the specific fields when needed. | Easy to implement. Reduce dependencies between classes as everything is in one class. Editing can be done all in one object.| Does not separate out the different functionalities of Task, Event and Reminder.
|2. Having separate classes for Task, Event, Reminder | Reduce dependencies as well as having functionalities separated. | Some attributes and methods overlap. Repetition of code for same functionality. Have to add all three objects individually. Editing of an item would require searching, obtaining and individually editing all 3 objects.
|3. *(Current)* Having a general Item class which comprise of `Optional<>` fields Task, Event, Reminder | Similar fields such as description and priority can be placed in Item. This makes adding an Item more convenient. Related task/event/reminder can have access to each other. | Increase coupling and dependency amongst Task, Event, Reminder classes.
|===
As of now, these are the considered designs and the current design seems to work well for our purpose. However, there could be better designs which are unexplored that could mitigate our cons and we welcome them. +

This is end of the section of adding a Task and Event. As mentioned above, adding of Reminder will be shown in a separate section due it having extra features. Do look out for it if you're interested.

=== Rescheduling of recurring Events automatically
This section talks about how the `autoReschedule` function is implemented. This feature aims to provide users with greater convenience when scheduling events that occur periodically (eg. weekly deadlines, monthly appointments).

==== Implementation
To reschedule a task, we need a deadline as we need to be able to calculate the next date. Recall that any Task with a deadline is considered an Event. As such, *only Events can be rescheduled.*

To automatically reschedule an Event, when creating the Event, include the `-auto` flag along with its reschedule period (eg `-auto day` for daily rescheduling) +
The accepted parameters for `-auto` is `day`, `week`, `month` and the format of `10.min.later`.

The following diagram shows the process of adding an Event with -auto flag:

.Activity diagram of adding an Event with -auto flag
image::AutoRescheduleActivity.png[100, 400]

In the diagram, when we add the Event initially, we would check the start time of the Event and update it accordingly.
However, this is not the only place where rescheduling occurs.

*3 places where rescheduling can occur:* +

. When the event is created, as shown in the diagram above.
. While the app is running, the Event's start time will be continuously updated when it has passed. +
This is done using `Timer` and `TimerTask`, using `Timer#scheduleAtFixedRate()`.
. When the app is started and Events are loaded from the storage. The stored Event time might already be over, as such the time has to be updated to the latest upcoming one.

To illustrate how they work, first we need to know what classes are involved before we can understand the sequence of actions carried out. +
The classes involved in the above rescheduling are: +

* `AutoReschedulePeriod` -- Represents the period of every reschedule (eg day/week/month)
* `RescheduleTask` -- Represents the action to perform when rescheduling its associated event.
* `AutoRescheduleManager` -- Manages all the rescheduling tasks. There is only one of such manager.

To better understand its underlying structure, we can look at the class diagram below:

.Class Diagram of classes involved in AutoReschedule function
image::AutoRescheduleClassDiagram.png[100, 500]

==== Internal workings of the command
Now we are ready to look at the sequence of actions. Given below is an example usage scenario of how add behaves at each step: +

Step 1. The user enters the command `event CS2103T Quiz -d 23/09/2019 2359 -auto week`. +
Step 2. The Event is created, following the sequence of steps in the section _Adding Task/Event_. However there are now some extra steps from Step 3 onwards that occur concurrently from the object creation of Event. +
Step 3. ... _{work in progress}_ +


The following diagrams show how the command `event Quiz -d 10.hour.later -auto week` is executed from the Logic component.
The first diagram shows the adding of an Event, which may appear familiar as it has a sequence similar to the adding of task in <<Add Task/Event feature>>. However, there are some minor differences due to the presence of `-auto` which should be noted.

.Call execute in LogicManager and create an AddEventCommand
image::AutoRescheduleSequence_1.png[]

As mentioned, the key points to take note of in the diagram above is `Event#setAutoReschedule(true)` and `Event#setReschedulePeriod(period)`. +
The significance of these methods will be shown in the continuing diagram below:

.LogicManager executing AddEventCommand and create task for AutoRescheduleManager
image::AutoRescheduleSequence_2.png[]

From the above diagram, we can see that the presence of `AutoReschedulePeriod` in Event results in the creation of `RescheduleTask` which would be queued into the Timer managed by `AutoRescheduleManager`.


==== Design considerations
The design considerations for the classes are shown below:
|===
|Alternatives: |Pros: |Cons:
|Creating a AutoRescheduleManager for every RescheduleTask | Easy for the Timer in AutoRescheduleManager to keep track of its TimerTask. | There could potentially be many Timer threads.
|*(Current)* Singleton pattern for AutoRescheduleManager |Ensure that only one instance can be instantiated as there should only be one manager for all the RescheduleTask. If there are multiple managers, it would be hard to keep track of all of them and it would be difficult to coordinate all the tasks. | Difficult to create tests for AutoResheduleManager. Could have many hidden dependencies, which makes code harder to maintain.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
