== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `Item` : Used by classes to represent a task, event, reminder or any combination of the three.
* `Task` : Used by classes to store, access and modify details regarding tasks.
* `Events` : Used by classes to store, access and modify details regarding events.
* `Reminders` : Used by classes to store, access and modify details regarding reminders.
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicComponentUML.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ElisaParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `ItemModel` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.
.  More instructions for the `Ui` can be given through implementing `ScrollCommand`

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Item Storage data
* exposes four observable lists that can be viewed by the Ui and will cause an update in the Ui when it is updated

[NOTE]
The reason for using four observable list as opposed to having one observable list that is filtered every time we update the list is because we believe that this will lead to faster loading time every time we switch view as it is just a change in the Visualization List pointer. This is better than the O(n) method of filtering a single VisualizeList as it will require going through all the items in the list.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Item Storage data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undobyreverse[]
=== [Implemented] Undo Feature
==== Current Implementation Logic

The undo function uses the revert command method without using states and history, unlike the proposed method.
This is because an issue was encountered with referencing lists and firing reminders multiple times when the state history method was used.

In this implementation, the commands that can be undone; that is, all the commands except `UndoCommand`, `ExitCommand`,
`UpCommand` and `DownCommand` now extend from an abstract class `UndoableCommand`, which is a subclass of Command.
Subclasses of `UndoableCommand` must implement a method `reverse(ItemModel model)`, which should do the exact opposite
of the `execute(ItemModel model)` in that Command.

The command execution history is stored in a stack, which is maintained in `ElisaCommandHistory`.

Below is a possible usage scenario and the app behaviour.

Step 1. The user executes `task eat`. A task with description "eat" is added and then the command is pushed into the commands stack.

image::UndoStackStep1.png[]

Step 2. The user realises that adding the task was a mistake, and decides to undo by entering `undo` into ELISA. The `undo` command
will pop the `AddTaskCommand` from the stack and reverse the effects of that command, in this case by deleting the task "eat" from the `TaskList`.

image::UndoStackStep2.png[]

Step 3. After successful execution of the `UndoCommand` a confirmation message is displayed in the chat box.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag:: priority[]
=== Priority Mode

==== Implementation

The priority mode is used to aid the user in focusing on the most pressing task that they have especially when they have many tasks in their list. As priority mode is only for clearing of tasks, the priority mode can only be activated at the task pane of the application.

The priority mode is mainly controlled in the ```ItemModelManager``` and the following are the methods it implements within the ```ItemModelManager```:

* ```ItemModelManager#togglePriorityMode()``` - Toggle the priority mode depending on whether it is on or off.
* ```ItemModelManager#toggleOnPriorityMode()``` - Helper function to toggle on the priority mode.
* ```ItemModelManager#toggleOffPriorityMode()``` - Helper function to toggle off the priority mode.

There are two variants to the priority mode, a normal priority mode that is controlled fully by the user and a scheduled priority mode that is triggered by the user but is scheduled to turn off after a specific amount of time. In addition to using the above three methods, the ```ScheduledPriorityMode``` also uses the following method:

* ```ItemModelManager#startTimer(LocalDateTime)``` - Starts a timer to turn off the priority mode.

==== Example run of code

In the following section, we will be showing a run of the priority mode and the behaviour of the mechanism at each step. In particular, we will be showing how the ```ScheduledPriorityMode``` works as it requires more step through the sequence diagram as compared to the ```PriorityMode```.

Step 1. The user opens his ELISA software. The first screen that he observes will be the task screen which contains all the task of the user based on the time they were added into the list.

Step 2. The user types ```priority 30.min.later``` into the command box of ELISA and hits enter. The list is instantly shrink to show only the most pressing task (i.e. the task with the highest priority). If two tasks have the same priority, either of the task will be shown as there is no other way for ELISA to compare between the two task.

Step 3. ELISA will automatically disable the priority mode after 30 minutes and show *all* the task that the user have in his task list currently.

The figure below shows the sequence diagram on what happens from a simple execution of the ```priority 30.min.later``` command.

.Sequence diagram for priority mode
image::PriorityMode.png[]

==== Internal working of the command
Referring to _Fig 3.2.2.a_, we will be going through step by step the internal mechanism of the execution of the ```ScheduledPriorityCommand```.

Step 1. When the user types in the command, the ```LogicManager``` takes in the command as a string and pass it to the ```AddressBookParser```

Step 2. The ```AddressBookParser``` parses the string and determine whether the command is that of a normal ```PriorityCommand``` or a ```ScheduledPriorityCommand```. In this case, the command is that of a ```ScheduledPriorityCommand``` and so a new ```ScheduledPriorityCommand``` is created. This ```ScheduledPriorityCommand``` is passed back to the ```LogicManager```. (Despite the fact that this is a ```ScheduledPriorityCommand```, the following steps marked with a * are also applicable to a normal ```PriorityCommand```).

Step 3*. Within the ```LogicManager```, the ```ScheduledPriorityCommand#execute()``` method is called and the command is executed.

Step 4. The ```ScheduledPriorityCommand``` calls the ```ItemModel#scheduleOffPriorityMethod()``` which creates a new ```Timer``` object and a new ```TimerTask``` object. The ```TimerTask``` object will be scheduled to fire off at a specific time, which in this case is 30 minutes later (as defined by the user).

Step 5*. The ```SchedulePriorityCommand``` then calls ```ItemModel#togglePriorityMode()``` which calls the private method ```ItemModel#toggleOnPriorityMode()``` (since the current state of the priority mode is false).

Step 6*. This creates a new ```TaskList``` which will be the visualization list for the Task Panel throughout the entire priority mode period.

Step 7*. A ```CommandResult``` is passed to the ```ScheduledPriorityCommand``` and then back to the ```LogicManager``` to be passed into the ```Ui```, informing the user that the priority mode is activate.

(At this point, a normal ```PriorityCommand``` will end the sequence diagram here and will only be deactivated by the user's input of ```priority``` again.)

.Sequence diagram for the scheduled turning off of priority mode
image::PriorityMode2.png[]

Step 8. As the ```Timer``` within the ```ItemModelManager``` is still running on a separate thread, it will trigger the ```TimerTask#run()``` when the user defined time is reached.

Step 9. The ```TimerTask``` will call ```ItemModelManager#toggleOffPriorityMode()``` which will cancel the ```Timer``` and destroy the ```Timer```. This is to ensure that the program can be closed properly.

Step 10. The items are all added back into the ```TaskList``` and the priority mode is considered deactivated.

==== Design Consideration
Aspect: How to turn off the priority mode after a fixed time

* **Alternative 1:** Having two different classes for activating the priority mode, a normal ```PriorityCommand``` and a ```ScheduledPriorityCommand``` that extends from the ```PriorityCommand```. The timer will be activated in the ```ScheduledPriorityCommand```.

** Pros: Adhere to the SLAP principle with each class having it's own implementation of the ```Command#execute(ItemModel)```. This makes it easier to maintain the code and prevents from overloading the ItemModel by keeping the timer there.

** Cons: There is no way to end the ```ScheduledPriorityCommand``` as the timer is kept within the command and so cannot be cancelled prematurely as there is no way to access the command after that.

* **Alternative 2 (Current choice)**: Having a timer within the ```ItemModelManager``` and having a specific method within the ```ItemModelManager``` to handle this creation of the timer.

** Pros: The scheduled priority mode can be controlled within the ```ItemModelManager``` and can then be controlled within the class such that it can be cancelled when it is done.

** Cons: This implementation will clutter the ```ItemModelManager``` further and make it harder for maintaining the code.

Alternative 2 was chosen as we believe that the functionality of the ```ScheduledPriorityMode``` takes priority over the maintainability of the code and should be used first until a better method can be created.

==== Possible extension

As of this moment, there is no way to display the status of the priority mode within the ```Ui``` other than through the list. One possible extension is turning have a label to signify that the user is in the priority mode.

At the moment, there is also no way to inform the user that the priority mode is disabled when it is scheduled to be off. However, this can be solved if the above extension is implemented as it will trigger the message when the mode switches.

// end:: priority[]
// tag::dataencryption[]

=== Add Task/Event feature
Task, Events and Reminders are all Items and can be added using the same command. Adding of Items is facilitated by ItemModel#add(Item). +

A Task with a deadline will also be considered an Event. As such, adding of a task and event will be demonstrated with the use of a single command. +

Given below is an example usage scenario of how add behaves at each step: +

Step 1. The user enters the command `"task shower -d 1.hour.later"`. +
Step 2. The LogicManager creates an AddressBookParser to parse the user input. +
Step 3. AddressBookParser creates a AddTaskCommandParser which parses the input and returns an AddCommand. +
Step 4. LogicManager will execute the AddCommand. AddCommand will then invoke `ItemModel#add(Item)`, which adds Task to its TaskList and Event to its EventList. +
Step 5. AddCommand will also trigger a change in view by calling `ItemModel#setVisualList(taskList)`
Step 6. Upon the successful execution of AddCommand, a CommandResult is returned to the LogicManager, which will then be returned to the Ui to render the appropriate view.

The figures below shows the sequence diagram on what happens from a simple execution of `task shower -d 1.min.later` user command: +

Figure 3.4.1b is a continuation of Figure 3.4.1a of the same AddCommand sequence.



=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
