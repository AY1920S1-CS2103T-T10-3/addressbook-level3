== PROJECT: ELISA

== Overview
My team of 5 software engineering students were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface (CLI) desktop address book application for our Software Engineering project.

As computing students, we face a lot of projects and assignments every day. The intense workload and fast-paced environment can make us forget the things that we need to do. We feel stressed out easily as we do not know how to manage all our tasks in an organised manner.

Therefore, my team came up with ELISA. ELISA stands for Exceptionally Loud and Intelligent Student Assistant. ELISA helps students by keeping track of all the tasks that he/she may have, as well as provide companionship to alleviate the stress.

== Application introduction
This is how our application looks like:
