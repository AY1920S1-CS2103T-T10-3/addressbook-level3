== PROJECT: ELISA

== Overview

My team of 5 were tasked with morphing or enhancing a basic command line interace (CLI) desktop address book application for our Software Engineering Project.

We were all computing students who were experiencing high amounts of stress from juggling the never-ending list of responsibilities we had.
We then realised that this was not a problem that was unique to ourselves, thus we resolved to develop an application to help reduce the stress of individuals like us.
We decided to morph the project into a student assistant we called ELISA. Our Extremely Intelligent n' Loud Student Assistant.
We decided that ELISA could help us through 5 ways.

1. She could help keep track of our tasks & events
2. She could help us focus on one task at a time when we feel overwhelmed.
3. She could remind us so that we don't have to constantly scan through the lists to ensure that we remember everything we need to.
4. She could entertain us.

This is how our user interface looks like:

My role was to implement the reminder and snooze functionality as well as Team Management.

== Summary of contributions

In this section, I will be briefly going through my contributions to this team project. For the full extent of my contributions to the project, please visit https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#=undefined&search=blimyj[here].

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
