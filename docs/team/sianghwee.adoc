== PROJECT: ELISA

== Overview
My team of 5 software engineering students were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface (CLI) desktop address book application for our Software Engineering project.

As we are living in a fast-paced world where things are constantly changing it can become stressful at times to keep track of the many tasks, events and reminders that we have. We thought that it would be helpful to have an application that is able to aid us in managing these tasks, so we chose to morph the address book into a student assistant with a personality to liven up our dreary day.

We decided to call her ELISA (Exceptionally Loud and Intelligent Student Assistant). This application enables users to add and track their tasks and events while receiving reminders for them. The assistant is in the form of a chat bot and she was given a sassy and humorous personality to enhance the user experience.

== Application introduction
This is how our application looks like:

The rest of the report will refer to this components and so their function will be briefly explained.

|===
|Component |Function

|ELISA icon
|Icon of the application. Will change with the different mode of the application.

|Result display
|The "chatbox" with ELISA which will contain all the users past input and ELISA response.

|Command box
|The area in which the user can type their command to interact with ELISA.

|View panel
|The current view of the application. It can show the task(currently showing), event, reminder or calendar panel.

== Summary of contributions

=== Functional contributions
* *Priority mode (Major Feature)*:

_What it does?_

This feature allows the user to enter a priority mode where they are able to prioritize tasks with a higher priority first.

_Why do it?_

This features help to solve the problem of students having too many tasks and being unsure of what task to complete first. It will help to alleviate the stress of the users.

_What's special?_

There are multiple modes for the user to choose from to suit their needs. Users can choose from a focus mode, a timed mode or just a normal mode. The individual mode will be explained in greater detail in the user guide.

* *Sorting (Minor Feature)*:

The sorting feature allows users to sort their items so that they are able to better arrange their items in a way that is most useful to them. Each of the different list have their own sorting algorithm while there are also general sorting using the priority or a description of an item.

* *Find (Minor Feature)*:

The find feature allows users to find an item based on the description of the item. This will aid the user in getting the item that they need at the fastest possible time.
