* Extremely Loud and Intelligent Student Assistant (ELISA) is for students who *want to have an intelligent companion that keeps track of tasks and give friendly reminders on when to take breaks*.
* More importantly, ELISA is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ELISA can get your tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
* It is a Java sample application intended for students learning Software Engineering while using Java as the main programming language.
* It is *written in OOP fashion*. It provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
